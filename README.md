# manual_shading_demo
Demonstration of manual shading in OpenGL using C++

Based on manual_shading branch https://github.com/borna-x86/lab4_irg, a solution to a part of the fourth lab excercise for https://www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/irg.

Demonstrates manually computing lighting in OpenGL (legacy) and C++ project structure and code style I usually use for small projects.

Depends on freeglut and GLM, and can be built with VS 2017/2019 Enterprise.
